# Real-Fake-Job-Classification-Job-Recommendation-System

##### The main objective for this project is to build the models that classifies the job posting as fake or real. And then, recommend the jobs to the user using the dataset. I found this dataset from Kaggle. I decided to use Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest and SVM to classify the job postings. Also, try to understand various parameters that job scammers target via exploratory data analysis. Using cosine similarity, I will try to build recommendation system to recommend the jobs to the user by capturing the inputs like job title, job type, function and country of interest from them.
